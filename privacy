Creating a privacy policy is an important step when developing a bot, especially for compliance and user trust. While I can provide you with a template, it's important to customize it according to your specific requirements and possibly consult with a legal expert to ensure it covers all necessary aspects. Here is a basic template for a privacy policy:

Please make sure to replace `[Bot Name]` with the actual name of your bot. You should host this privacy policy on a website or a document-sharing service where users can access it via a link. For example, you can use GitHub Pages, Google Docs, or similar services to host the document and generate a shareable link.
